* How to build this software

1.) Install Qt 4.7. Or just install the whole Qt SDK (http://qt.nokia.com/downloads) including the QtCreator IDE.
2.) Install Jack. You can install jack1 (also known as jackd) as well as jack2 (also known as jackdmp), which is currently available in version 1.9.6 (http://jackaudio.org/download)
    You will also need libjack (the development library for Jack).
3.) Modify the project file electrocillin.pro such as to include your libjack include and library paths, as well as the libraries libjack and libjackserver (the latter only on Windows).
Note: on Linux you probably won't have to change anything, as libjack typically resides in /usr/include and /usr/lib, which will already be in search paths when building.
4.) Build the project. You can do this either via QtCreator or manually. For the latter it should be sufficient to run
    $ qmake -o Makefile elektrocillin.pro
    $ make
Note: be sure to have all necessary tools in your path. On Windows you could probably use the "Qt command prompt" instead of the standard console.

* How to run the software

The software depends on Jack. Make sure you have a functioning Jack installation. Start the Jack server before starting the elektrocillin exectuable or make sure that it is
started automatically when accessing the Jack library. A nice tool for using Jack is qjackctl (http://http://qjackctl.sourceforge.net/), which is also Qt-based.
Have fun and be advised that this software is currently very experimental!
